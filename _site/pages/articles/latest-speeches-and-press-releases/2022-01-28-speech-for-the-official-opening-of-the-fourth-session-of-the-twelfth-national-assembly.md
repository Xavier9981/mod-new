##### INTRODUCTION

##### MR. SPEAKER,

1. I am privileged and honoured to once again address this august house and the nation at large during this auspicious occasion of opening the fourth session of the twelfth national assembly.

2. The state of the nation address is the major platform,that i, as head of state, has the mandate to use as an avenue to foster engagement with the legislature and the executive to delve in depth on the issues that affect our country.

3. This state of the nation address provides an over-arching guidance for all duty holders, beginning with my entire cabinet and all government officials, to work closely with the people to provide solutions to problems that confront us, and to consistently inform our people on activities being undertaken by the executive on their behalf through parliamentary oversights, media discussions, consultations with various stakeholders and indeed consistent press releases.

4. This model, in my view is more effective than what a single press brief can do. Hence the reason why the executive comprising a team of cabinet ministers with different portfolio functions has a duty to address and attend to a broader spectrum of people, consistently.
